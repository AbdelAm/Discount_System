=> The solution is about a system that manage Discount Codes, it generates discount codes and check if the discount code provided by the user is valid or not

=> The solution is a Console App, is splited into 2 parts, server part and client part
    - Server Part: where the discount codes generated and saved into file, it contains also the logic used to check if the discount code provided by the user is valid or not
    - Client Part: to test the system, where you can type your discount code and check if it's valid or not

Both solutions should be run seperatly, they use TCP Socket to communicate between each other in asynchronous way
